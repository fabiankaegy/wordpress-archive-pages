# wordpress-archive-pages
This is an exploration into how archive pages could tie in better into editable areas in WordPress. Like the Post Page

## Idea:
In WordPress core there is a toggle in the settings and in the cusomizer to chose what page should get used as the blog page. So it therefore allows editors to choose the permalink and heading of a Post type archive page. I would like to see that feature extended so that any CPT can opt into it. So editors can chose a page that they habe created and named as the archive page. 
This would allow editors to have more controll over Archive pages and for example set meta values, change the permalink. This then also allows theme developers to add more capabilities to archive pages. By default the editor would be dissabled like it is of the blog page, but in theory archives could make use of that content and add it above / beneath the content. Or use a featured image for a header.
